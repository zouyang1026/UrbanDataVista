# Urban Data Vista - Interactive Web Mapping Application

## Overview

Developed by Zhanpeng Ouyang under the guidance of Professor Zhao Bo, Urban Data Vista is an interactive web mapping application that visualizes dynamic geospatial data layers of Seattle. This project aims to provide intuitive insights into urban development, traffic infrastructure, and future city planning regarding open spaces for the year 2035.

Utilizing cutting-edge web technologies and geospatial data analysis, this application allows users to explore various aspects of urban life within Seattle, enhancing the understanding of urban dynamics and infrastructure.

## Features

- **Interactive Base Maps**: Users can navigate through different layers, including a detailed street map and a projection of future city planning.
- **Traffic Cameras Visualization**: Integration of real-time traffic camera data to assess current traffic conditions.
- **Future City Planning**: A visionary layer showcasing the potential development of city-owned open spaces by 2035.
- **Layer Toggling**: An interactive menu allows users to switch between different map layers for comparative analysis.
- **Zoom Level Adaptation**: Each layer is optimized for various zoom levels, maintaining clarity and detail from a macro city-wide view to micro-level streets.

## Technology Stack

- **Mapbox GL JS**: Leveraging Mapbox GL JS for its powerful interactive mapping capabilities.
- **QGIS**: Utilized for geospatial data processing and tile generation.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and version control.
- **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**: Core web development technologies for structuring, styling, and scripting the application.
